# Tennessee Early Intervention System

[The Tennessee Early Intervention System (TEIS)](https://www.tn.gov/didd/for-consumers/tennessee-early-intervention-system-teis.html) is a program that provides services to children ages birth up to age three who have disabilities or other developmental delays.

The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) requires states to provide an annual report to the public about the performance of early intervention service programs (EIS programs) compared to the state's performance on indicator targets. This reporting is done for any child enrolled in TEIS for at least six months. Currently, this six month threshold is calculated based on initial individual family service plan (IFSP) date and final exit date. However, children sometimes leave the program and return at a later date, resulting in less than six months of services received but six months between initial entry and exit.
